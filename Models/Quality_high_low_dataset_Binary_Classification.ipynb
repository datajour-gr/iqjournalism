       "      <td>Around 1,200 carriages, one in every 11 in the fleet, allowed to keep running – to avoid mass new year service cancellations. The deadline of 1 January 2020 to make all trains accessible for disabled people has been ripped up in what has been branded the first “broken promise” since Boris Johnson’s election win. Around 1,200 carriages – many of them on notorious northern routes, already dogged by delays and cancellations – will continue running into the next decade, -- can reveal. The tally is one in every 11 in the fleet and 50 per cent higher than the number that rail companies had asked for permission to keep in operation, despite having had a full decade to prepare. Some cannot accommodate wheelchairs, while others lack audio-visual information systems, easy to use handholds and handrails, or an accessible toilet – if toilets are fitted at all. The move was sharply criticised by campaigners for better transport and for people with disabilities as a bitter new year pill for passengers to swallow. PM’s new Brexit bill scraps powers for MPs to scrutinise trade deal Tanni Grey-Thompson, the multi gold medal-winning Paralympian, said: “I’m hugely disappointed. The rail industry has to urgently address what it is going to do to allow accessible transport and be transparent with its plans. “It feels like there is tinkering around the edges. They’ve had plenty of time but just kept pushing it into the long grass.” Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “With 10 years to prepare for the deadline to make trains accessible, this is a delay too far and has let down disabled passengers.” And Andy McDonald, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: “This government is not yet a week old, but is already breaking its promises. “They said these clapped-out trains would go and disabled passengers would have better access. You can’t believe a word they say.” No fewer than 10 operating companies have been granted permission to breach the accessibility standards that were due to come into force on 1 January. They include Northern Rail and its infamous Pacer trains – bus frames mounted on train wheels as a “stopgap” measure more than 30 years ago – which David Cameron vowed to banish way back in 2014. A total of 180 Pacers will remain in use. In a letter seen by --, Chris Heaton-Harris, the rail minister, said he had “reluctantly agreed” to loosen the deadline, but blamed the rail companies. The new plan is for the carriages to be replaced between April and next December – a full year’s delay – although it is unclear how achievable those new deadlines will be. The Queen’s speech: what she said – and what Boris Johnson meantQueen’s Speech promises ‘radical’ review of constitution and courtsDespite the Tories, we can still have our first climate parliamentInside Politics: Boris Johnson has the Queen read yet another speech The minister’s letter says: “Despite such a significant period of time for the rail industry to prepare, I understand that were all non-compliant trains removed from service there would be a disproportionately negative effect on the provision of services for passengers. “Thus I have reluctantly agreed to issue strictly time-limited dispensation notices to a number of operators for around 1,200 carriages in the national fleet.” Mr Heaton-Harris said the rail firms must do more “to prevent the practice of operating rail replacement bus and coach services that are not compliant with relevant accessibility regulations”. Where non-compliant buses were used, they “must provide passengers who require it with accessible alternative transport, such as taxis”, the letter said.  Northern and Transport for Wales (TfW) had already made clear they would have to continue to use Pacer trains, which have no dedicated spaces for passengers using wheelchairs. Northern blamed a delay in the arrival of new trains being built by a Spanish manufacturer, while TfW said trains refurbished by rolling stock company Porterbrook would not be ready.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged to the front of the Democratic pack by promising “big, structural change” — including a “Medicare for all” program that would bring health insurance to all Americans and eliminate private coverage. But at Tuesday’s presidential debate, she again refused to say whether taxes would go up in order to pay for such a program. That reticence suggests that Ms. Warren, who was an Oklahoma-born Republican decades before she became a liberal Massachusetts senator, worries about alienating voters fearful of higher taxes and bigger government. By contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote the Medicare for All bill that Ms. Warren has said she supports, openly admitted on Tuesday that taxes would go up but that any increase would be “substantially less” than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Polling data show that Democrats are largely united in their willingness to pay higher taxes in exchange for a government-run health insurance system. But it is unclear if the broader electorate — which is sympathetic to Mr. Sanders’s and Ms. Warren’s calls for a wealth tax of the superrich — would accept a middle-class tax hike in exchange for such a system. Soon after the debate, Mr. Sanders announced he would be receiving endorsements from two young high-profile progressives: Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who backed him on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is expected to endorse him at a rally in Queens on Saturday. By proudly embracing his left-wing agenda, Mr. Sanders is staking a claim to the liberal-most parts of the Democratic base, while banking on his ability to still build a diverse coalition. While Ms. Warren is also angling for support from the party’s left wing, she has avoided mentioning middle-class tax hikes that might alarm moderate voters whom she is trying to peel away from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and some of whom she would need to win a general election. “She’s positioned herself pretty effectively as someone who has a plan and has thought it out, but the burden is on her to explain the math around the plan,” Doug Sosnik, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, said of Ms. Warren’s support for Medicare for all. Most Democrats Support Medicare for All A recent Des Moines Register/--/Mediacom poll showed that roughly 7 in 10 Democratic voters in Iowa, the first state to vote next year, said they were “comfortable” with a Medicare for all system, though about two out of every five voters in that group worried that embracing this position “could cost Democrats the election.” In national polls, Democratic voters have overwhelmingly said they would accept higher taxes to fund a government-run health system that covers all Americans. A --/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system. But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes. And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split. In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats. Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey. Who’s Paying? Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do. A tax hike for the wealthy is broadly popular — especially among Democrats, but also with independents. “Voters across the board actually support higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations,” John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. “But in terms of understanding whether people are supportive of raising their own taxes to get certain social benefits, the evidence is mixed.” Polling data suggest that in recent years, the country has grown less resistant to federal taxation. In both 2018 and 2019, Americans responding to Gallup polls have been more likely to say that the amount of federal income tax they pay is “about right,” rather than “too high.” This marks the first time since the 1950s, when Gallup started asking the question, that public opinion has swung that way two years in a row. Only a quarter of those polled by Gallup this year said they were “very dissatisfied” with the amount of taxes Americans pay — the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 2001. But most of that change has taken place among Republicans, who have historically been the most averse to federal taxation. This shift may speak to Republicans’ satisfaction with President Trump’s 2017 tax law — which broadly lowered taxes, but delivered the greatest benefits to wealthier Americans — more than an increased willingness to be taxed in exchange for public services. But the Trump tax law has added to the view among most Americans that the federal tax system unfairly favors the rich. In a March Pew poll, 80 percent of Americans said they were bothered at least somewhat by “the feeling that some wealthy people don’t pay their fair share” in taxes. Therefore, Mr. Hudak said, the message of a wealth tax could catch on with the general electorate. Whether this will transform into additional support for Medicare for all remains uncertain. “Simply because something can be paid for with a tax increase on the wealthy doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea in all Americans’ eyes,” he said. With regards to Medicare for all, he said, “those who are skeptical of it are skeptical beyond what it would cost. They’re skeptical about implementation, they’re skeptical about access, and in some cases they’re skeptical that that system will be better than the current health care system for them personally.”</td>\n",

With regards to Medicare for all, he said, “those who are skeptical of it are skeptical beyond what it would cost. They’re skeptical about implementation, they’re skeptical about access, and in some cases they’re skeptical that that system will be better than the current health care system for them personally.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>It took less than a day after major Saudi oil facilities came under attack this weekend for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to blame Iran directly. The swiftness of the judgment raised eyebrows in Washington and around the world, triggering immediate comparisons to the run-up to the Iraq War in 2002 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration evoked the specter of a “mushroom cloud” to make the case for intervention in the Middle East. It took until Wednesday morning for Saudi Arabia to back up Pompeo’s claim, with the Saudi defense ministry explicitly pointing to Iran and ruling out Yemen as the source of the drones and cruise missiles. In a dramatic news conference in Riyadh, Saudi officials displayed wrecked pieces of several recovered weapons and said the attack had come from the north, though they hadn’t pinpointed the launch site. In the interim, skepticism of the U.S.’ credibility started to pour in. “This administration that lies about, whether maps or crowd sizes, cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told --. Colin Kahl, a former top national security aide in the Obama White House, tweeted: “Establishing whether Iran launched the attack &amp; what an appropriate response would be are tough issues that would benefit from US international credibility—credibility Trump has squandered as a result of his America First approach &amp; constant lying.” The Trump administration on Sunday released satellite photos it said proved the attack emanated from the north — not from Yemen’s Houthi rebels to the south, who had claimed responsibility. GOP senators emerged from a briefing Tuesday sounding pretty confident about Iran’s culpability. -- and The Wall Street Journal reported on additional intelligence pointing to Iran. And an array of experts told -- that it seems likely Iran was behind in the attacks in some fashion. So why the credibility gap? Part of the problem, Iran experts and former national security officials said, is the way Pompeo and President Donald Trump rushed to finger Iran before laying out a clear case or bringing allies on board. -Pompeo’s comments “preceded evidence,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served in several GOP administrations. “It’s better to get the evidence out and then the judgments.”  Haass added: “And second of all, he is one of those most associated in this administration with an anti-Iranian policy. So it just looked like he was leaning forward too much.” Then there’s the president himself: Trump’s unusually high tally of public falsehoods has weakened trust in his pronouncements. So far, he’s made 12,019 false or misleading statements since taking office, per -- (5,276 false as of May, per the Toronto Star) on subjects as minor as “Morning Joe” ratings and as major as the existence of his signature border wall. “At a minimum, if someone is constantly making errors and needs to be fact-checked, it breeds cynicism about the truthfulness of what they say,” said Angie Drobnic Holan, editor of the Pulitzer-winning PolitiFact, which has evaluated 713 Trump statements and deemed more than two-thirds “mostly false” or worse. “I think that would apply to anyone in any context.” And finally, there’s the long Iraq War hangover, with “weapons of mass destruction” still ringing in the ears of a war-weary public. And apparently the president, too: Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that while a military strike wasn’t off the table, “how did going into Iraq work out?” Iran, whose M.O. this year has been gradual escalation under the veneer of plausible deniability, can harness such an environment to its benefit. The drone strikes on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq processing facility and Khurais oil field hammered 5.7 million daily barrels of crude production, roughly 5 percent of the worldwide supply, and triggered the largest daily jump in oil prices in a decade. Typically, former national security officials said, the U.S. evaluates several types of intelligence to make a determination of responsibility after incidents like this, drawing conclusions at various confidence levels. Then it tries to marshal support from foreign allies — and members of Congress — behind the scenes by sharing as much intelligence as it deems appropriate. In this case, Pompeo’s tweets preceded all that. Even Trump wasn’t as definitive in the subsequent days, saying “certainly it would look” like Iran did it.  The U.K., France and Japan all said they were still reviewing intelligence, or that they hadn’t yet seen evidence of Iranian culpability. The U.S. has so far failed to recruit many allies if it does want to retaliate militarily. In part, the American case for blaming Iran depends on what the Trump administration wants to achieve. Trump on Wednesday announced significant (and vague) sanctions forthcoming — but he’s leaning against military action. Experts said it seemed likely the administration simply wanted to keep building the case for its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran. “If you’re just trying to blame Iran … there’s no leverage that has to be applied” with allies, said Jon Wolfsthal, senior adviser at Global Zero and a former Obama NSC senior director. “There’s no diplomacy at work there. If, however, we actually want to have coordinated effective response, then the bar climbs.” But in this case, experts said, the evidence does indicate that Iran bears at least some responsibility for the explosions in Saudi Arabia, its regional arch-enemy. Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the attack was “very, very precise to a stunning degree,” indicating a level of sophistication far beyond previous Houthi attacks. “People are very critical of Trump, for very understandable reasons, and then might be too critical of many of the intelligence” reports, he added. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday that while Vice President Mike Pence’s briefing to the Senate GOP was short, he found it “pretty convincing Iran is responsible.” He added that once that’s “absolutely” confirmed, the United States should come up with a response with its allies. “The Trump administration has to put American interests over the financial oil interests of the Saudi royal family and must come to Congress with more credible and persuasive evidence that we’ve seen so far if they’re going to blame the Iranians,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. “They owe us a better, fuller set of evidence and facts.” The nature of classified intelligence often gives government officials an uphill battle in convincing the public, others noted. “From my experience, there is always skepticism in this type of scenario, when you’re announcing a conclusion based on intelligence you can’t share,” said Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute, who worked in the George W. Bush White House. “And it’s something that really bedevils policymakers.” The specter of the Iraq War lead-up, when Secretary of State Colin Powell famously told the United Nations about Iraqi weapons that did not in fact exist, still looms large. Standing on the floor of the Security Council chamber, he brandished a model vial of anthrax as a sign of the dangers and told the world, “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.” Years later, Powell would acknowledge that some of the intelligence was inaccurate and that he regretted the speech. “You don’t want a repeat of the Iraq War, but at the same time you don’t want an Iraq War hangover to impede you in this analysis,” warned Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But some of Trump’s credibility gap stems from issues that are uniquely of his administration’s own making. “I don’t think they’re credible in the way they’ve said it, particularly Secretary of State Pompeo,” said retired Col. Larry Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to Powell and thought Tuesday that the Iran-backed Houthis were still the likeliest culprits. “I just think they are reinforcing the, if you will, 2002/2003 image of, this is WMD in Iraq.” Daniel Lippman and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report. -</td>\n",

       "      <td>Theresa May’s room for manoeuvre should her Brexit deal be rejected next week was further constrained on Wednesday night, after the government lost a second dramatic parliamentary showdown in as many days. An increasingly boxed-in prime minister must now set out her plan B within three working days of a defeat next Tuesday, after the rebel amendment passed.  There were furious scenes in the House of Commons as the Speaker, John Bercow, took the controversial decision to allow a vote on the amendment, tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. A string of MPs, including the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, repeatedly intervened to question the Speaker’s approach. Some accused him of being biased against Brexit. But parliament went on to back Grieve as the prime minister was defied by Conservative rebels determined to hand control of the Brexit process to MPs if next week’s vote is lost. The fresh defeat, which followed a separate backbench amendment to the finance bill on Tuesday, means the government will have to return to parliament swiftly with a plan. An accelerated timetable will also pile the pressure on Labour to move quickly. The motion setting out the government’s plan can be amended by MPs hoping to push their own alternative proposals, from a second referendum to a harder Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn’s party will have to decide which to back. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Wednesday became the most senior Labour figure to suggest that the article 50 process might have to be extended, if the deadlock in parliament could not be broken. He told MPs: “There is a question of the extension of article 50, which may well be inevitable now, given the position that we are in, but of course we can only seek it, because the other 27 [EU members] have to agree.” Will the proposal solve anything? The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.  That committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  But it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.  If the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.  The backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.  The new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.  But an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.  The Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is  a no-deal Brexit.  Extending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.  Staying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.  Starmer also said: “We are going to have to look at what available options are realistically still on the table and what now are the merits of each of them.” Corbyn will use a speech in Wakefield on Thursday to step up his demands for a general election, and frame Labour’s approach to next week’s key vote and the steps the party will take afterwards. “A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,” he will say. “To break the deadlock, an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option.” He will insist the best way to overcome the divisions that drove the Brexit vote is to elect a Labour government. Government sources on Wednesday night confirmed reports that they are considering making another concession, on workers’ rights, in a bid to win over Labour MPs. May could accept an amendment backed by MPs including Labour’s John Mann, that would offer stronger protections for workers’ rights after Brexit. Mann was among a group of Labour MPs who met the prime minister on Wednesday to discuss what changes she could make to win their support for her deal, with other attendees including Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell. Meanwhile, May will seek to underline international support for her stance, as she welcomes the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to Britain. The pair will announce a series of trade and cultural collaborations, and hail the end of an export ban on British meat products to Japan. The government announced details of new concessions on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, announced that the government would accept a proposal from the Tory MP Hugo Swire that will allow MPs to vote, before the Irish backstop is implemented, if a trade deal has not been reached by mid-2020. May’s spokesman said the plan would give MPs the options of implementing the backstop, extending the transition period, or “alternative ways you could look at, including technology”. But the idea that it would strengthen MPs’ powers to prevent the backstop coming into force was swiftly dismissed in Brussels. An EU diplomat said: “This is a purely internal arrangement in the UK. What counts is the treaty and the legally binding commitments in the treaty and why would the UK not want to honour its international obligations?” Asked if the EU would have to concur with whatever decision was reached, the spokesman said it would not. “My understanding on that is that it’s a decision for the UK parliament as to which route we choose to go down.” However, one senior Brexiter agreed with the view in Brussels that the withdrawal treaty, once ratified, would trump any vote in Westminster. “That’s the point of international treaties!” he said. More details were also announced of the so-called “Stormont lock”, giving the Northern Ireland assembly a “strong role” in regulatory arrangements if the backstop comes into force. But with the assembly currently suspended, a paper published by the government setting out the plans was quickly rubbished by the Democratic Unionist party. Winning over the DUP was at the heart of No 10’s strategy for smoothing the path to May’s deal being passed by parliament. But there has been little sign since the new year that its resolve to reject the deal has weakened. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader at Westminster, described the latest proposals as “cosmetic and meaningless”. Earlier, Bercow had clashed repeatedly with MPs over his decision to fly in the face of parliamentary convention and allow the Grieve motion to be voted on. “The chair is simply seeking to discharge the responsibility of the holder of the office to the best of his ability,” he insisted, speaking about himself in the third person. “That is what I have always done, and no matter what people say or how forcefully they say it, or how many times they say it or by what manner of coordination it is said, I will continue to do what I believe to be right.” The Conservative Simon Hoare was one of the MPs expressing concern. He said the decision plunged parliament into “pretty choppy and dangerous waters at the time in our nation’s affairs when, frankly, we can least afford it”. Another MP challenged the Speaker about a sticker on his car that “makes derogatory comments about Brexit”. Bercow shot back that the car belonged to his wife. Rebel backbenchers believe the decision to allow the vote strengthens their hand in what they expect to be a series of battles in the days ahead, as they seek to prevent the government leading Britain out of the EU without a deal. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of the amendment. A spokesman said: “Our intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote.”  This article was amended on 10 January 2019. The quote from the MP Simon Hoare was originally misattributed to Peter Bone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For more than three decades, Charles King has made it his business to fight for vulnerable New Yorkers, much of that time leading Housing Works, a nonprofit organization created in 1990 to find housing for homeless people who had H.I.V. As Housing Works grew, so did its ambition. It began to provide various social services to homeless and low-income people affected by AIDS, while maintaining its activist roots in its fights with New York City for proper funding, or in its protests of Republican members of Congress who supported rolling back the Affordable Care Act. But now Mr. King and Housing Works find themselves in an unusual position: Over 100 employees walked off the job on Tuesday to protest the organization’s resistance to their bid to form a union. The workers say that Housing Works’s stance demonstrates the organization’s embrace of corporate values, and is a betrayal of its core identity. “Any organization that calls itself a social justice organization that champions itself as a vanguard of progressive ideals, they should be supporting and allowing workers to assert their rights through a union,” said Elena Rodriguez, a lawyer at Housing Works who has aided the unionization efforts. “I don’t think the two are at odds.” The walkout comes nearly a year after workers began organizing with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in an effort to get Housing Works to address a number of grievances — such as heavy caseloads, high insurance premiums and restrictions on paid time off — that they say have eroded the workplace culture and made it difficult to serve their clients. Workers said they had hoped that Housing Works, which has hosted public events featuring labor leaders and demonstrated alongside unions, would be more supportive of their efforts. Instead, they say Housing Works has employed hardball tactics that corporations often use in resisting unionization. For instance, it has hired a lawyer who specializes in union avoidance and has refused to hand over a list of employee contact information. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said a major sticking point in the talks with Housing Works was the nonprofit’s refusal to sign an agreement that would bar it from interfering in union organizing. “Even large, for-profit entities that do not consider themselves progressive in any way agree to neutrality,” he said. Mr. Appelbaum said that his union had repeatedly tried to negotiate the terms of the agreement, but that Mr. King had not been receptive. The union also plans to file unfair labor practice charges against Housing Works, claiming it has intimidated workers before the walkout. Mr. King says the agency has an open-door policy that gives workers access to management and encourages lower-level workers to share ideas and grievances. He said that Housing Works was not opposed in principle to signing a neutrality agreement, but that he believed that certain provisions in the agreement were biased in favor of the union. “It’s not for me to say that these employees should recognize this union as their bargaining entity,” he said. “The union needs to do its job and sell itself to our employees.” Founded in 1990 at the height of the AIDS pandemic by Mr. King and other leaders from the AIDS activist group Act Up, Housing Works set out to combat the virus by providing housing to homeless and low-income New Yorkers living with H.I.V. Although it started as a small charity with only six employees, Housing Works has morphed into one of the largest comprehensive service providers in the nation for people with H.I.V., employing nearly 800 workers. This year, it merged with Bailey House, another service provider in New York. The organization funds its programs and advocacy work through grants and donations, as well as a sprawling retail operation that includes 13 thrift stores and one bookstore. Mr. King acknowledges that the organization is changing, but denies that its leadership is anti-union. He says Housing Works has maintained the spirit of community through policies that encourage workers to share their ideas and concerns. Not all of his employees agree. Ms. Rodriguez, the staff lawyer, said that landing a job there was a dream come true. But soon after she started, Ms. Rodriguez said, she noticed things that she believed contradicted the organization’s progressive values. The tipping point for Ms. Rodriguez came about a year ago, after a colleague who was fired had to pack up her things in front of everyone in the office before being escorted from the building. “It was really, really hard for us to believe that Housing Works would treat someone who was part of our staff and part of our family in such a heartless and sort of corporate way,” she said. Brian Grady, a housing coordinator, said that as a gay man, he was first attracted to Housing Works because of the legacy it earned during the AIDS pandemic. Although he enjoyed his work, Mr. Grady said the workload had begun to wear him down. For months, he was the only housing coordinator for a program with nearly 3,000 clients. “It’s difficult work,” he said. “We work with people who are going through some of the worst times in their lives and are going through a lot of really unstable situations. As workers we take a lot of that home, especially when we’re hearing these stories day after day with limited resources to help.” Part of the problem is high turnover. Workers said that the demanding nature of their jobs meant that people were frequently coming and going. According to Housing Works’s 2019-20 strategic objective plan, its annual turnover rate is about 30 percent. Ms. Rodriguez said the organization’s high turnover rate hurt Housing Works’s clients. She spoke about one client who was evicted and had to enter the shelter system because Housing Works could not find her a new home in time. “Over the course of more than a year, I saw her shuffled to three new case managers,” Ms. Rodriguez said, adding, “I can’t help but think back to that client and wonder what we could have done better to assist her.” Mr. King said that he sympathized with workers’ concerns, but that he doubted a union would be able to solve all of their issues. “Housing Works already pays much higher than the average salary for community-based organizations in New York City and we already have much lower caseloads,” he said. “So the likelihood that it’s going to dramatically change, that is just not real in a Medicaid-funded program.”</td>\n",

       "0  Around 1,200 carriages, one in every 11 in the fleet, allowed to keep running – to avoid mass new year service cancellations. The deadline of 1 January 2020 to make all trains accessible for disabled people has been ripped up in what has been branded the first “broken promise” since Boris Johnson’s election win. Around 1,200 carriages – many of them on notorious northern routes, already dogged by delays and cancellations – will continue running into the next decade, -- can reveal. The tally is one in every 11 in the fleet and 50 per cent higher than the number that rail companies had asked for permission to keep in operation, despite having had a full decade to prepare. Some cannot accommodate wheelchairs, while others lack audio-visual information systems, easy to use handholds and handrails, or an accessible toilet – if toilets are fitted at all. The move was sharply criticised by campaigners for better transport and for people with disabilities as a bitter new year pill for passengers to swallow. PM’s new Brexit bill scraps powers for MPs to scrutinise trade deal Tanni Grey-Thompson, the multi gold medal-winning Paralympian, said: “I’m hugely disappointed. The rail industry has to urgently address what it is going to do to allow accessible transport and be transparent with its plans. “It feels like there is tinkering around the edges. They’ve had plenty of time but just kept pushing it into the long grass.” Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “With 10 years to prepare for the deadline to make trains accessible, this is a delay too far and has let down disabled passengers.” And Andy McDonald, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: “This government is not yet a week old, but is already breaking its promises. “They said these clapped-out trains would go and disabled passengers would have better access. You can’t believe a word they say.” No fewer than 10 operating companies have been granted permission to breach the accessibility standards that were due to come into force on 1 January. They include Northern Rail and its infamous Pacer trains – bus frames mounted on train wheels as a “stopgap” measure more than 30 years ago – which David Cameron vowed to banish way back in 2014. A total of 180 Pacers will remain in use. In a letter seen by --, Chris Heaton-Harris, the rail minister, said he had “reluctantly agreed” to loosen the deadline, but blamed the rail companies. The new plan is for the carriages to be replaced between April and next December – a full year’s delay – although it is unclear how achievable those new deadlines will be. The Queen’s speech: what she said – and what Boris Johnson meantQueen’s Speech promises ‘radical’ review of constitution and courtsDespite the Tories, we can still have our first climate parliamentInside Politics: Boris Johnson has the Queen read yet another speech The minister’s letter says: “Despite such a significant period of time for the rail industry to prepare, I understand that were all non-compliant trains removed from service there would be a disproportionately negative effect on the provision of services for passengers. “Thus I have reluctantly agreed to issue strictly time-limited dispensation notices to a number of operators for around 1,200 carriages in the national fleet.” Mr Heaton-Harris said the rail firms must do more “to prevent the practice of operating rail replacement bus and coach services that are not compliant with relevant accessibility regulations”. Where non-compliant buses were used, they “must provide passengers who require it with accessible alternative transport, such as taxis”, the letter said.  Northern and Transport for Wales (TfW) had already made clear they would have to continue to use Pacer trains, which have no dedicated spaces for passengers using wheelchairs. Northern blamed a delay in the arrival of new trains being built by a Spanish manufacturer, while TfW said trains refurbished by rolling stock company Porterbrook would not be ready.

       "1  Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged to the front of the Democratic pack by promising “big, structural change” — including a “Medicare for all” program that would bring health insurance to all Americans and eliminate private coverage. But at Tuesday’s presidential debate, she again refused to say whether taxes would go up in order to pay for such a program. That reticence suggests that Ms. Warren, who was an Oklahoma-born Republican decades before she became a liberal Massachusetts senator, worries about alienating voters fearful of higher taxes and bigger government. By contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote the Medicare for All bill that Ms. Warren has said she supports, openly admitted on Tuesday that taxes would go up but that any increase would be “substantially less” than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Polling data show that Democrats are largely united in their willingness to pay higher taxes in exchange for a government-run health insurance system. But it is unclear if the broader electorate — which is sympathetic to Mr. Sanders’s and Ms. Warren’s calls for a wealth tax of the superrich — would accept a middle-class tax hike in exchange for such a system. Soon after the debate, Mr. Sanders announced he would be receiving endorsements from two young high-profile progressives: Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who backed him on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is expected to endorse him at a rally in Queens on Saturday. By proudly embracing his left-wing agenda, Mr. Sanders is staking a claim to the liberal-most parts of the Democratic base, while banking on his ability to still build a diverse coalition. While Ms. Warren is also angling for support from the party’s left wing, she has avoided mentioning middle-class tax hikes that might alarm moderate voters whom she is trying to peel away from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and some of whom she would need to win a general election. “She’s positioned herself pretty effectively as someone who has a plan and has thought it out, but the burden is on her to explain the math around the plan,” Doug Sosnik, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, said of Ms. Warren’s support for Medicare for all. Most Democrats Support Medicare for All A recent Des Moines Register/--/Mediacom poll showed that roughly 7 in 10 Democratic voters in Iowa, the first state to vote next year, said they were “comfortable” with a Medicare for all system, though about two out of every five voters in that group worried that embracing this position “could cost Democrats the election.” In national polls, Democratic voters have overwhelmingly said they would accept higher taxes to fund a government-run health system that covers all Americans. A --/Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system. But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes. And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split. In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats. Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey. Who’s Paying? Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do. A tax hike for the wealthy is broadly popular — especially among Democrats, but also with independents. “Voters across the board actually support higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations,” John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. “But in terms of understanding whether people are supportive of raising their own taxes to get certain social benefits, the evidence is mixed.” Polling data suggest that in recent years, the country has grown less resistant to federal taxation. In both 2018 and 2019, Americans responding to Gallup polls have been more likely to say that the amount of federal income tax they pay is “about right,” rather than “too high.” This marks the first time since the 1950s, when Gallup started asking the question, that public opinion has swung that way two years in a row. Only a quarter of those polled by Gallup this year said they were “very dissatisfied” with the amount of taxes Americans pay — the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 2001. But most of that change has taken place among Republicans, who have historically been the most averse to federal taxation. This shift may speak to Republicans’ satisfaction with President Trump’s 2017 tax law — which broadly lowered taxes, but delivered the greatest benefits to wealthier Americans — more than an increased willingness to be taxed in exchange for public services. But the Trump tax law has added to the view among most Americans that the federal tax system unfairly favors the rich. In a March Pew poll, 80 percent of Americans said they were bothered at least somewhat by “the feeling that some wealthy people don’t pay their fair share” in taxes. Therefore, Mr. Hudak said, the message of a wealth tax could catch on with the general electorate. Whether this will transform into additional support for Medicare for all remains uncertain. “Simply because something can be paid for with a tax increase on the wealthy doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea in all Americans’ eyes,” he said. With regards to Medicare for all, he said, “those who are skeptical of it are skeptical beyond what it would cost. They’re skeptical about implementation, they’re skeptical about access, and in some cases they’re skeptical that that system will be better than the current health care system for them personally.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2  It took less than a day after major Saudi oil facilities came under attack this weekend for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to blame Iran directly. The swiftness of the judgment raised eyebrows in Washington and around the world, triggering immediate comparisons to the run-up to the Iraq War in 2002 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration evoked the specter of a “mushroom cloud” to make the case for intervention in the Middle East. It took until Wednesday morning for Saudi Arabia to back up Pompeo’s claim, with the Saudi defense ministry explicitly pointing to Iran and ruling out Yemen as the source of the drones and cruise missiles. In a dramatic news conference in Riyadh, Saudi officials displayed wrecked pieces of several recovered weapons and said the attack had come from the north, though they hadn’t pinpointed the launch site. In the interim, skepticism of the U.S.’ credibility started to pour in. “This administration that lies about, whether maps or crowd sizes, cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told --. Colin Kahl, a former top national security aide in the Obama White House, tweeted: “Establishing whether Iran launched the attack & what an appropriate response would be are tough issues that would benefit from US international credibility—credibility Trump has squandered as a result of his America First approach & constant lying.” The Trump administration on Sunday released satellite photos it said proved the attack emanated from the north — not from Yemen’s Houthi rebels to the south, who had claimed responsibility. GOP senators emerged from a briefing Tuesday sounding pretty confident about Iran’s culpability. -- and The Wall Street Journal reported on additional intelligence pointing to Iran. And an array of experts told -- that it seems likely Iran was behind in the attacks in some fashion. So why the credibility gap? Part of the problem, Iran experts and former national security officials said, is the way Pompeo and President Donald Trump rushed to finger Iran before laying out a clear case or bringing allies on board. -Pompeo’s comments “preceded evidence,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served in several GOP administrations. “It’s better to get the evidence out and then the judgments.”  Haass added: “And second of all, he is one of those most associated in this administration with an anti-Iranian policy. So it just looked like he was leaning forward too much.” Then there’s the president himself: Trump’s unusually high tally of public falsehoods has weakened trust in his pronouncements. So far, he’s made 12,019 false or misleading statements since taking office, per -- (5,276 false as of May, per the Toronto Star) on subjects as minor as “Morning Joe” ratings and as major as the existence of his signature border wall. “At a minimum, if someone is constantly making errors and needs to be fact-checked, it breeds cynicism about the truthfulness of what they say,” said Angie Drobnic Holan, editor of the Pulitzer-winning PolitiFact, which has evaluated 713 Trump statements and deemed more than two-thirds “mostly false” or worse. “I think that would apply to anyone in any context.” And finally, there’s the long Iraq War hangover, with “weapons of mass destruction” still ringing in the ears of a war-weary public. And apparently the president, too: Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that while a military strike wasn’t off the table, “how did going into Iraq work out?” Iran, whose M.O. this year has been gradual escalation under the veneer of plausible deniability, can harness such an environment to its benefit. The drone strikes on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq processing facility and Khurais oil field hammered 5.7 million daily barrels of crude production, roughly 5 percent of the worldwide supply, and triggered the largest daily jump in oil prices in a decade. Typically, former national security officials said, the U.S. evaluates several types of intelligence to make a determination of responsibility after incidents like this, drawing conclusions at various confidence levels. Then it tries to marshal support from foreign allies — and members of Congress — behind the scenes by sharing as much intelligence as it deems appropriate. In this case, Pompeo’s tweets preceded all that. Even Trump wasn’t as definitive in the subsequent days, saying “certainly it would look” like Iran did it.  The U.K., France and Japan all said they were still reviewing intelligence, or that they hadn’t yet seen evidence of Iranian culpability. The U.S. has so far failed to recruit many allies if it does want to retaliate militarily. In part, the American case for blaming Iran depends on what the Trump administration wants to achieve. Trump on Wednesday announced significant (and vague) sanctions forthcoming — but he’s leaning against military action. Experts said it seemed likely the administration simply wanted to keep building the case for its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran. “If you’re just trying to blame Iran … there’s no leverage that has to be applied” with allies, said Jon Wolfsthal, senior adviser at Global Zero and a former Obama NSC senior director. “There’s no diplomacy at work there. If, however, we actually want to have coordinated effective response, then the bar climbs.” But in this case, experts said, the evidence does indicate that Iran bears at least some responsibility for the explosions in Saudi Arabia, its regional arch-enemy. Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the attack was “very, very precise to a stunning degree,” indicating a level of sophistication far beyond previous Houthi attacks. “People are very critical of Trump, for very understandable reasons, and then might be too critical of many of the intelligence” reports, he added. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday that while Vice President Mike Pence’s briefing to the Senate GOP was short, he found it “pretty convincing Iran is responsible.” He added that once that’s “absolutely” confirmed, the United States should come up with a response with its allies. “The Trump administration has to put American interests over the financial oil interests of the Saudi royal family and must come to Congress with more credible and persuasive evidence that we’ve seen so far if they’re going to blame the Iranians,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. “They owe us a better, fuller set of evidence and facts.” The nature of classified intelligence often gives government officials an uphill battle in convincing the public, others noted. “From my experience, there is always skepticism in this type of scenario, when you’re announcing a conclusion based on intelligence you can’t share,” said Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute, who worked in the George W. Bush White House. “And it’s something that really bedevils policymakers.” The specter of the Iraq War lead-up, when Secretary of State Colin Powell famously told the United Nations about Iraqi weapons that did not in fact exist, still looms large. Standing on the floor of the Security Council chamber, he brandished a model vial of anthrax as a sign of the dangers and told the world, “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.” Years later, Powell would acknowledge that some of the intelligence was inaccurate and that he regretted the speech. “You don’t want a repeat of the Iraq War, but at the same time you don’t want an Iraq War hangover to impede you in this analysis,” warned Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But some of Trump’s credibility gap stems from issues that are uniquely of his administration’s own making. “I don’t think they’re credible in the way they’ve said it, particularly Secretary of State Pompeo,” said retired Col. Larry Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to Powell and thought Tuesday that the Iran-backed Houthis were still the likeliest culprits. “I just think they are reinforcing the, if you will, 2002/2003 image of, this is WMD in Iraq.” Daniel Lippman and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report. -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3  Theresa May’s room for manoeuvre should her Brexit deal be rejected next week was further constrained on Wednesday night, after the government lost a second dramatic parliamentary showdown in as many days. An increasingly boxed-in prime minister must now set out her plan B within three working days of a defeat next Tuesday, after the rebel amendment passed.  There were furious scenes in the House of Commons as the Speaker, John Bercow, took the controversial decision to allow a vote on the amendment, tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. A string of MPs, including the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, repeatedly intervened to question the Speaker’s approach. Some accused him of being biased against Brexit. But parliament went on to back Grieve as the prime minister was defied by Conservative rebels determined to hand control of the Brexit process to MPs if next week’s vote is lost. The fresh defeat, which followed a separate backbench amendment to the finance bill on Tuesday, means the government will have to return to parliament swiftly with a plan. An accelerated timetable will also pile the pressure on Labour to move quickly. The motion setting out the government’s plan can be amended by MPs hoping to push their own alternative proposals, from a second referendum to a harder Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn’s party will have to decide which to back. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Wednesday became the most senior Labour figure to suggest that the article 50 process might have to be extended, if the deadlock in parliament could not be broken. He told MPs: “There is a question of the extension of article 50, which may well be inevitable now, given the position that we are in, but of course we can only seek it, because the other 27 [EU members] have to agree.” Will the proposal solve anything? The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.  That committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  But it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.  If the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.  The backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.  The new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.  But an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.  The Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is  a no-deal Brexit.  Extending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.  Staying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.  Starmer also said: “We are going to have to look at what available options are realistically still on the table and what now are the merits of each of them.” Corbyn will use a speech in Wakefield on Thursday to step up his demands for a general election, and frame Labour’s approach to next week’s key vote and the steps the party will take afterwards. “A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,” he will say. “To break the deadlock, an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option.” He will insist the best way to overcome the divisions that drove the Brexit vote is to elect a Labour government. Government sources on Wednesday night confirmed reports that they are considering making another concession, on workers’ rights, in a bid to win over Labour MPs. May could accept an amendment backed by MPs including Labour’s John Mann, that would offer stronger protections for workers’ rights after Brexit. Mann was among a group of Labour MPs who met the prime minister on Wednesday to discuss what changes she could make to win their support for her deal, with other attendees including Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell. Meanwhile, May will seek to underline international support for her stance, as she welcomes the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to Britain. The pair will announce a series of trade and cultural collaborations, and hail the end of an export ban on British meat products to Japan. The government announced details of new concessions on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, announced that the government would accept a proposal from the Tory MP Hugo Swire that will allow MPs to vote, before the Irish backstop is implemented, if a trade deal has not been reached by mid-2020. May’s spokesman said the plan would give MPs the options of implementing the backstop, extending the transition period, or “alternative ways you could look at, including technology”. But the idea that it would strengthen MPs’ powers to prevent the backstop coming into force was swiftly dismissed in Brussels. An EU diplomat said: “This is a purely internal arrangement in the UK. What counts is the treaty and the legally binding commitments in the treaty and why would the UK not want to honour its international obligations?” Asked if the EU would have to concur with whatever decision was reached, the spokesman said it would not. “My understanding on that is that it’s a decision for the UK parliament as to which route we choose to go down.” However, one senior Brexiter agreed with the view in Brussels that the withdrawal treaty, once ratified, would trump any vote in Westminster. “That’s the point of international treaties!” he said. More details were also announced of the so-called “Stormont lock”, giving the Northern Ireland assembly a “strong role” in regulatory arrangements if the backstop comes into force. But with the assembly currently suspended, a paper published by the government setting out the plans was quickly rubbished by the Democratic Unionist party. Winning over the DUP was at the heart of No 10’s strategy for smoothing the path to May’s deal being passed by parliament. But there has been little sign since the new year that its resolve to reject the deal has weakened. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader at Westminster, described the latest proposals as “cosmetic and meaningless”. Earlier, Bercow had clashed repeatedly with MPs over his decision to fly in the face of parliamentary convention and allow the Grieve motion to be voted on. “The chair is simply seeking to discharge the responsibility of the holder of the office to the best of his ability,” he insisted, speaking about himself in the third person. “That is what I have always done, and no matter what people say or how forcefully they say it, or how many times they say it or by what manner of coordination it is said, I will continue to do what I believe to be right.” The Conservative Simon Hoare was one of the MPs expressing concern. He said the decision plunged parliament into “pretty choppy and dangerous waters at the time in our nation’s affairs when, frankly, we can least afford it”. Another MP challenged the Speaker about a sticker on his car that “makes derogatory comments about Brexit”. Bercow shot back that the car belonged to his wife. Rebel backbenchers believe the decision to allow the vote strengthens their hand in what they expect to be a series of battles in the days ahead, as they seek to prevent the government leading Britain out of the EU without a deal. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of the amendment. A spokesman said: “Our intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote.”  This article was amended on 10 January 2019. The quote from the MP Simon Hoare was originally misattributed to Peter Bone.   \n",
       "4  For more than three decades, Charles King has made it his business to fight for vulnerable New Yorkers, much of that time leading Housing Works, a nonprofit organization created in 1990 to find housing for homeless people who had H.I.V. As Housing Works grew, so did its ambition. It began to provide various social services to homeless and low-income people affected by AIDS, while maintaining its activist roots in its fights with New York City for proper funding, or in its protests of Republican members of Congress who supported rolling back the Affordable Care Act. But now Mr. King and Housing Works find themselves in an unusual position: Over 100 employees walked off the job on Tuesday to protest the organization’s resistance to their bid to form a union. The workers say that Housing Works’s stance demonstrates the organization’s embrace of corporate values, and is a betrayal of its core identity. “Any organization that calls itself a social justice organization that champions itself as a vanguard of progressive ideals, they should be supporting and allowing workers to assert their rights through a union,” said Elena Rodriguez, a lawyer at Housing Works who has aided the unionization efforts. “I don’t think the two are at odds.” The walkout comes nearly a year after workers began organizing with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in an effort to get Housing Works to address a number of grievances — such as heavy caseloads, high insurance premiums and restrictions on paid time off — that they say have eroded the workplace culture and made it difficult to serve their clients. Workers said they had hoped that Housing Works, which has hosted public events featuring labor leaders and demonstrated alongside unions, would be more supportive of their efforts. Instead, they say Housing Works has employed hardball tactics that corporations often use in resisting unionization. For instance, it has hired a lawyer who specializes in union avoidance and has refused to hand over a list of employee contact information. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said a major sticking point in the talks with Housing Works was the nonprofit’s refusal to sign an agreement that would bar it from interfering in union organizing. “Even large, for-profit entities that do not consider themselves progressive in any way agree to neutrality,” he said. Mr. Appelbaum said that his union had repeatedly tried to negotiate the terms of the agreement, but that Mr. King had not been receptive. The union also plans to file unfair labor practice charges against Housing Works, claiming it has intimidated workers before the walkout. Mr. King says the agency has an open-door policy that gives workers access to management and encourages lower-level workers to share ideas and grievances. He said that Housing Works was not opposed in principle to signing a neutrality agreement, but that he believed that certain provisions in the agreement were biased in favor of the union. “It’s not for me to say that these employees should recognize this union as their bargaining entity,” he said. “The union needs to do its job and sell itself to our employees.” Founded in 1990 at the height of the AIDS pandemic by Mr. King and other leaders from the AIDS activist group Act Up, Housing Works set out to combat the virus by providing housing to homeless and low-income New Yorkers living with H.I.V. Although it started as a small charity with only six employees, Housing Works has morphed into one of the largest comprehensive service providers in the nation for people with H.I.V., employing nearly 800 workers. This year, it merged with Bailey House, another service provider in New York. The organization funds its programs and advocacy work through grants and donations, as well as a sprawling retail operation that includes 13 thrift stores and one bookstore. Mr. King acknowledges that the organization is changing, but denies that its leadership is anti-union. He says Housing Works has maintained the spirit of community through policies that encourage workers to share their ideas and concerns. Not all of his employees agree. Ms. Rodriguez, the staff lawyer, said that landing a job there was a dream come true. But soon after she started, Ms. Rodriguez said, she noticed things that she believed contradicted the organization’s progressive values. The tipping point for Ms. Rodriguez came about a year ago, after a colleague who was fired had to pack up her things in front of everyone in the office before being escorted from the building. “It was really, really hard for us to believe that Housing Works would treat someone who was part of our staff and part of our family in such a heartless and sort of corporate way,” she said. Brian Grady, a housing coordinator, said that as a gay man, he was first attracted to Housing Works because of the legacy it earned during the AIDS pandemic. Although he enjoyed his work, Mr. Grady said the workload had begun to wear him down. For months, he was the only housing coordinator for a program with nearly 3,000 clients. “It’s difficult work,” he said. “We work with people who are going through some of the worst times in their lives and are going through a lot of really unstable situations. As workers we take a lot of that home, especially when we’re hearing these stories day after day with limited resources to help.” Part of the problem is high turnover. Workers said that the demanding nature of their jobs meant that people were frequently coming and going. According to Housing Works’s 2019-20 strategic objective plan, its annual turnover rate is about 30 percent. Ms. Rodriguez said the organization’s high turnover rate hurt Housing Works’s clients. She spoke about one client who was evicted and had to enter the shelter system because Housing Works could not find her a new home in time. “Over the course of more than a year, I saw her shuffled to three new case managers,” Ms. Rodriguez said, adding, “I can’t help but think back to that client and wonder what we could have done better to assist her.” Mr. King said that he sympathized with workers’ concerns, but that he doubted a union would be able to solve all of their issues. “Housing Works already pays much higher than the average salary for community-based organizations in New York City and we already have much lower caseloads,” he said. “So the likelihood that it’s going to dramatically change, that is just not real in a Medicaid-funded program.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "0  Around 1,200 carriages, one in every 11 in the fleet, allowed to keep running – to avoid mass new year service cancellations. The deadline of 1 January 2020 to make all trains accessible for disabled people has been ripped up in what has been branded the first “broken promise” since Boris Johnson’s election win. Around 1,200 carriages – many of them on notorious northern routes, already dogged by delays and cancellations – will continue running into the next decade, -- can reveal. The tally is one in every 11 in the fleet and 50 per cent higher than the number that rail companies had asked for permission to keep in operation, despite having had a full decade to prepare. Some cannot accommodate wheelchairs, while others lack audio-visual information systems, easy to use handholds and handrails, or an accessible toilet – if toilets are fitted at all. The move was sharply criticised by campaigners for better transport and for people with disabilities as a bitter new year pill for passengers to swallow. PM’s new Brexit bill scraps powers for MPs to scrutinise trade deal Tanni Grey-Thompson, the multi gold medal-winning Paralympian, said: “I’m hugely disappointed. The rail industry has to urgently address what it is going to do to allow accessible transport and be transparent with its plans. “It feels like there is tinkering around the edges. They’ve had plenty of time but just kept pushing it into the long grass.” Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said: “With 10 years to prepare for the deadline to make trains accessible, this is a delay too far and has let down disabled passengers.” And Andy McDonald, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: “This government is not yet a week old, but is already breaking its promises. “They said these clapped-out trains would go and disabled passengers would have better access. You can’t believe a word they say.” No fewer than 10 operating companies have been granted permission to breach the accessibility standards that were due to come into force on 1 January. They include Northern Rail and its infamous Pacer trains – bus frames mounted on train wheels as a “stopgap” measure more than 30 years ago – which David Cameron vowed to banish way back in 2014. A total of 180 Pacers will remain in use. In a letter seen by --, Chris Heaton-Harris, the rail minister, said he had “reluctantly agreed” to loosen the deadline, but blamed the rail companies. The new plan is for the carriages to be replaced between April and next December – a full year’s delay – although it is unclear how achievable those new deadlines will be. The Queen’s speech: what she said – and what Boris Johnson meantQueen’s Speech promises ‘radical’ review of constitution and courtsDespite the Tories, we can still have our first climate parliamentInside Politics: Boris Johnson has the Queen read yet another speech The minister’s letter says: “Despite such a significant period of time for the rail industry to prepare, I understand that were all non-compliant trains removed from service there would be a disproportionately negative effect on the provision of services for passengers. “Thus I have reluctantly agreed to issue strictly time-limited dispensation notices to a number of operators for around 1,200 carriages in the national fleet.” Mr Heaton-Harris said the rail firms must do more “to prevent the practice of operating rail replacement bus and coach services that are not compliant with relevant accessibility regulations”. Where non-compliant buses were used, they “must provide passengers who require it with accessible alternative transport, such as taxis”, the letter said.  Northern and Transport for Wales (TfW) had already made clear they would have to continue to use Pacer trains, which have no dedicated spaces for passengers using wheelchairs. Northern blamed a delay in the arrival of new trains being built by a Spanish manufacturer, while TfW said trains refurbished by rolling stock company Porterbrook would not be ready.

       "1  Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged to the front of the Democratic pack by promising “big, structural change” — including a “Medicare for all” program that would bring health insurance to all Americans and eliminate private coverage. But at Tuesday’s presidential debate, she again refused to say whether taxes would go up in order to pay for such a program. That reticence suggests that Ms. Warren, who was an Oklahoma-born Republican decades before she became a liberal Massachusetts senator, worries about alienating voters fearful of higher taxes and bigger government. By contrast, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote the Medicare for All bill that Ms. Warren has said she supports, openly admitted on Tuesday that taxes would go up but that any increase would be “substantially less” than what people currently pay for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Polling data show that Democrats are largely united in their willingness to pay higher taxes in exchange for a government-run health insurance system. But it is unclear if the broader electorate — which is sympathetic to Mr. Sanders’s and Ms. Warren’s calls for a wealth tax of the superrich — would accept a middle-class tax hike in exchange for such a system. Soon after the debate, Mr. Sanders announced he would be receiving endorsements from two young high-profile progressives: Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who backed him on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is expected to endorse him at a rally in Queens on Saturday. By proudly embracing his left-wing agenda, Mr. Sanders is staking a claim to the liberal-most parts of the Democratic base, while banking on his ability to still build a diverse coalition. While Ms. Warren is also angling for support from the party’s left wing, she has avoided mentioning middle-class tax hikes that might alarm moderate voters whom she is trying to peel away from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and some of whom she would need to win a general election. “She’s positioned herself pretty effectively as someone who has a plan and has thought it out, but the burden is on her to explain the math around the plan,” Doug Sosnik, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, said of Ms. Warren’s support for Medicare for all. Most Democrats Support Medicare for All A recent Des Moines Register -- Mediacom poll showed that roughly 7 in 10 Democratic voters in Iowa, the first state to vote next year, said they were “comfortable” with a Medicare for all system, though about two out of every five voters in that group worried that embracing this position “could cost Democrats the election.” In national polls, Democratic voters have overwhelmingly said they would accept higher taxes to fund a government-run health system that covers all Americans. A -- Wall Street Journal poll in July found that 72 percent of Democratic voters nationwide, largely liberals, said they would support a taxpayer-funded, single-payer health care system. Even moderate and conservative Democratic voters supported the idea, at 57 percent. Younger Democratic voters were particularly likely to back a single-payer system. But support was mushier across party lines, according to the poll. Just 44 percent of all American voters supported a single-payer plan funded by taxes. And when given a choice between Medicare for all and a public option, even Democrats remain split. In a July study, Pew researchers found that 4 in 5 Democrats believed it was the government’s responsibility to ensure all Americans have health care. But in a follow-up question on how it should be administered, just 44 percent of all Democrats favored a Medicare for all model, while an additional 34 percent said they would like to see a public option operating alongside private insurers — the approach favored by Mr. Biden and more moderate Democrats. Among the general population, just over a quarter of Americans said they would choose a Medicare for all-type system, according to the Pew survey. Who’s Paying? Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have made two claims central to their candidacies: that only Medicare for all would be enough to make health care affordable for every American, and that the richest Americans ought to pay far more in taxes than they currently do. A tax hike for the wealthy is broadly popular — especially among Democrats, but also with independents. “Voters across the board actually support higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations,” John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. “But in terms of understanding whether people are supportive of raising their own taxes to get certain social benefits, the evidence is mixed.” Polling data suggest that in recent years, the country has grown less resistant to federal taxation. In both 2018 and 2019, Americans responding to Gallup polls have been more likely to say that the amount of federal income tax they pay is “about right,” rather than “too high.” This marks the first time since the 1950s, when Gallup started asking the question, that public opinion has swung that way two years in a row. Only a quarter of those polled by Gallup this year said they were “very dissatisfied” with the amount of taxes Americans pay — the lowest percentage since the question was first asked in 2001. But most of that change has taken place among Republicans, who have historically been the most averse to federal taxation. This shift may speak to Republicans’ satisfaction with President Trump’s 2017 tax law — which broadly lowered taxes, but delivered the greatest benefits to wealthier Americans — more than an increased willingness to be taxed in exchange for public services. But the Trump tax law has added to the view among most Americans that the federal tax system unfairly favors the rich. In a March Pew poll, 80 percent of Americans said they were bothered at least somewhat by “the feeling that some wealthy people don’t pay their fair share” in taxes. Therefore, Mr. Hudak said, the message of a wealth tax could catch on with the general electorate. Whether this will transform into additional support for Medicare for all remains uncertain. “Simply because something can be paid for with a tax increase on the wealthy doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea in all Americans’ eyes,” he said. With regards to Medicare for all, he said, “those who are skeptical of it are skeptical beyond what it would cost. They’re skeptical about implementation, they’re skeptical about access, and in some cases they’re skeptical that that system will be better than the current health care system for them personally.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2  It took less than a day after major Saudi oil facilities came under attack this weekend for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to blame Iran directly. The swiftness of the judgment raised eyebrows in Washington and around the world, triggering immediate comparisons to the run-up to the Iraq War in 2002 and 2003, when the George W. Bush administration evoked the specter of a “mushroom cloud” to make the case for intervention in the Middle East. It took until Wednesday morning for Saudi Arabia to back up Pompeo’s claim, with the Saudi defense ministry explicitly pointing to Iran and ruling out Yemen as the source of the drones and cruise missiles. In a dramatic news conference in Riyadh, Saudi officials displayed wrecked pieces of several recovered weapons and said the attack had come from the north, though they hadn’t pinpointed the launch site. In the interim, skepticism of the U.S.’ credibility started to pour in. “This administration that lies about, whether maps or crowd sizes, cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told --. Colin Kahl, a former top national security aide in the Obama White House, tweeted: “Establishing whether Iran launched the attack & what an appropriate response would be are tough issues that would benefit from US international credibility—credibility Trump has squandered as a result of his America First approach & constant lying.” The Trump administration on Sunday released satellite photos it said proved the attack emanated from the north — not from Yemen’s Houthi rebels to the south, who had claimed responsibility. GOP senators emerged from a briefing Tuesday sounding pretty confident about Iran’s culpability. -- and The Wall Street Journal reported on additional intelligence pointing to Iran. And an array of experts told -- that it seems likely Iran was behind in the attacks in some fashion. So why the credibility gap? Part of the problem, Iran experts and former national security officials said, is the way Pompeo and President Donald Trump rushed to finger Iran before laying out a clear case or bringing allies on board. -Pompeo’s comments “preceded evidence,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served in several GOP administrations. “It’s better to get the evidence out and then the judgments.”  Haass added: “And second of all, he is one of those most associated in this administration with an anti-Iranian policy. So it just looked like he was leaning forward too much.” Then there’s the president himself: Trump’s unusually high tally of public falsehoods has weakened trust in his pronouncements. So far, he’s made 12,019 false or misleading statements since taking office, per -- (5,276 false as of May, per the Toronto Star) on subjects as minor as “Morning Joe” ratings and as major as the existence of his signature border wall. “At a minimum, if someone is constantly making errors and needs to be fact-checked, it breeds cynicism about the truthfulness of what they say,” said Angie Drobnic Holan, editor of the Pulitzer-winning PolitiFact, which has evaluated 713 Trump statements and deemed more than two-thirds “mostly false” or worse. “I think that would apply to anyone in any context.” And finally, there’s the long Iraq War hangover, with “weapons of mass destruction” still ringing in the ears of a war-weary public. And apparently the president, too: Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that while a military strike wasn’t off the table, “how did going into Iraq work out?” Iran, whose M.O. this year has been gradual escalation under the veneer of plausible deniability, can harness such an environment to its benefit. The drone strikes on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq processing facility and Khurais oil field hammered 5.7 million daily barrels of crude production, roughly 5 percent of the worldwide supply, and triggered the largest daily jump in oil prices in a decade. Typically, former national security officials said, the U.S. evaluates several types of intelligence to make a determination of responsibility after incidents like this, drawing conclusions at various confidence levels. Then it tries to marshal support from foreign allies — and members of Congress — behind the scenes by sharing as much intelligence as it deems appropriate. In this case, Pompeo’s tweets preceded all that. Even Trump wasn’t as definitive in the subsequent days, saying “certainly it would look” like Iran did it.  The U.K., France and Japan all said they were still reviewing intelligence, or that they hadn’t yet seen evidence of Iranian culpability. The U.S. has so far failed to recruit many allies if it does want to retaliate militarily. In part, the American case for blaming Iran depends on what the Trump administration wants to achieve. Trump on Wednesday announced significant (and vague) sanctions forthcoming — but he’s leaning against military action. Experts said it seemed likely the administration simply wanted to keep building the case for its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran. “If you’re just trying to blame Iran … there’s no leverage that has to be applied” with allies, said Jon Wolfsthal, senior adviser at Global Zero and a former Obama NSC senior director. “There’s no diplomacy at work there. If, however, we actually want to have coordinated effective response, then the bar climbs.” But in this case, experts said, the evidence does indicate that Iran bears at least some responsibility for the explosions in Saudi Arabia, its regional arch-enemy. Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the attack was “very, very precise to a stunning degree,” indicating a level of sophistication far beyond previous Houthi attacks. “People are very critical of Trump, for very understandable reasons, and then might be too critical of many of the intelligence” reports, he added. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday that while Vice President Mike Pence’s briefing to the Senate GOP was short, he found it “pretty convincing Iran is responsible.” He added that once that’s “absolutely” confirmed, the United States should come up with a response with its allies. “The Trump administration has to put American interests over the financial oil interests of the Saudi royal family and must come to Congress with more credible and persuasive evidence that we’ve seen so far if they’re going to blame the Iranians,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. “They owe us a better, fuller set of evidence and facts.” The nature of classified intelligence often gives government officials an uphill battle in convincing the public, others noted. “From my experience, there is always skepticism in this type of scenario, when you’re announcing a conclusion based on intelligence you can’t share,” said Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute, who worked in the George W. Bush White House. “And it’s something that really bedevils policymakers.” The specter of the Iraq War lead-up, when Secretary of State Colin Powell famously told the United Nations about Iraqi weapons that did not in fact exist, still looms large. Standing on the floor of the Security Council chamber, he brandished a model vial of anthrax as a sign of the dangers and told the world, “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.” Years later, Powell would acknowledge that some of the intelligence was inaccurate and that he regretted the speech. “You don’t want a repeat of the Iraq War, but at the same time you don’t want an Iraq War hangover to impede you in this analysis,” warned Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But some of Trump’s credibility gap stems from issues that are uniquely of his administration’s own making. “I don’t think they’re credible in the way they’ve said it, particularly Secretary of State Pompeo,” said retired Col. Larry Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to Powell and thought Tuesday that the Iran-backed Houthis were still the likeliest culprits. “I just think they are reinforcing the, if you will, 2002 2003 image of, this is WMD in Iraq.” Daniel Lippman and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report. -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3  Theresa May’s room for manoeuvre should her Brexit deal be rejected next week was further constrained on Wednesday night, after the government lost a second dramatic parliamentary showdown in as many days. An increasingly boxed-in prime minister must now set out her plan B within three working days of a defeat next Tuesday, after the rebel amendment passed.  There were furious scenes in the House of Commons as the Speaker, John Bercow, took the controversial decision to allow a vote on the amendment, tabled by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. A string of MPs, including the leader of the house, Andrea Leadsom, repeatedly intervened to question the Speaker’s approach. Some accused him of being biased against Brexit. But parliament went on to back Grieve as the prime minister was defied by Conservative rebels determined to hand control of the Brexit process to MPs if next week’s vote is lost. The fresh defeat, which followed a separate backbench amendment to the finance bill on Tuesday, means the government will have to return to parliament swiftly with a plan. An accelerated timetable will also pile the pressure on Labour to move quickly. The motion setting out the government’s plan can be amended by MPs hoping to push their own alternative proposals, from a second referendum to a harder Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn’s party will have to decide which to back. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, on Wednesday became the most senior Labour figure to suggest that the article 50 process might have to be extended, if the deadlock in parliament could not be broken. He told MPs: “There is a question of the extension of article 50, which may well be inevitable now, given the position that we are in, but of course we can only seek it, because the other 27 [EU members] have to agree.” Will the proposal solve anything? The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.  That committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  But it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.  If the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.  The backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.  The new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.  But an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.  The Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is  a no-deal Brexit.  Extending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.  Staying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the European court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.  Starmer also said: “We are going to have to look at what available options are realistically still on the table and what now are the merits of each of them.” Corbyn will use a speech in Wakefield on Thursday to step up his demands for a general election, and frame Labour’s approach to next week’s key vote and the steps the party will take afterwards. “A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all. So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call that election, and let the people decide,” he will say. “To break the deadlock, an election is not only the most practical option, it is also the most democratic option.” He will insist the best way to overcome the divisions that drove the Brexit vote is to elect a Labour government. Government sources on Wednesday night confirmed reports that they are considering making another concession, on workers’ rights, in a bid to win over Labour MPs. May could accept an amendment backed by MPs including Labour’s John Mann, that would offer stronger protections for workers’ rights after Brexit. Mann was among a group of Labour MPs who met the prime minister on Wednesday to discuss what changes she could make to win their support for her deal, with other attendees including Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell. Meanwhile, May will seek to underline international support for her stance, as she welcomes the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to Britain. The pair will announce a series of trade and cultural collaborations, and hail the end of an export ban on British meat products to Japan. The government announced details of new concessions on the Brexit deal on Wednesday, in an attempt to win over sceptics. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, announced that the government would accept a proposal from the Tory MP Hugo Swire that will allow MPs to vote, before the Irish backstop is implemented, if a trade deal has not been reached by mid-2020. May’s spokesman said the plan would give MPs the options of implementing the backstop, extending the transition period, or “alternative ways you could look at, including technology”. But the idea that it would strengthen MPs’ powers to prevent the backstop coming into force was swiftly dismissed in Brussels. An EU diplomat said: “This is a purely internal arrangement in the UK. What counts is the treaty and the legally binding commitments in the treaty and why would the UK not want to honour its international obligations?” Asked if the EU would have to concur with whatever decision was reached, the spokesman said it would not. “My understanding on that is that it’s a decision for the UK parliament as to which route we choose to go down.” However, one senior Brexiter agreed with the view in Brussels that the withdrawal treaty, once ratified, would trump any vote in Westminster. “That’s the point of international treaties!” he said. More details were also announced of the so-called “Stormont lock”, giving the Northern Ireland assembly a “strong role” in regulatory arrangements if the backstop comes into force. But with the assembly currently suspended, a paper published by the government setting out the plans was quickly rubbished by the Democratic Unionist party. Winning over the DUP was at the heart of No 10’s strategy for smoothing the path to May’s deal being passed by parliament. But there has been little sign since the new year that its resolve to reject the deal has weakened. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader at Westminster, described the latest proposals as “cosmetic and meaningless”. Earlier, Bercow had clashed repeatedly with MPs over his decision to fly in the face of parliamentary convention and allow the Grieve motion to be voted on. “The chair is simply seeking to discharge the responsibility of the holder of the office to the best of his ability,” he insisted, speaking about himself in the third person. “That is what I have always done, and no matter what people say or how forcefully they say it, or how many times they say it or by what manner of coordination it is said, I will continue to do what I believe to be right.” The Conservative Simon Hoare was one of the MPs expressing concern. He said the decision plunged parliament into “pretty choppy and dangerous waters at the time in our nation’s affairs when, frankly, we can least afford it”. Another MP challenged the Speaker about a sticker on his car that “makes derogatory comments about Brexit”. Bercow shot back that the car belonged to his wife. Rebel backbenchers believe the decision to allow the vote strengthens their hand in what they expect to be a series of battles in the days ahead, as they seek to prevent the government leading Britain out of the EU without a deal. Downing Street sought to play down the significance of the amendment. A spokesman said: “Our intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote.”  This article was amended on 10 January 2019. The quote from the MP Simon Hoare was originally misattributed to Peter Bone.   \n",
       "4  For more than three decades, Charles King has made it his business to fight for vulnerable New Yorkers, much of that time leading Housing Works, a nonprofit organization created in 1990 to find housing for homeless people who had H.I.V. As Housing Works grew, so did its ambition. It began to provide various social services to homeless and low-income people affected by AIDS, while maintaining its activist roots in its fights with New York City for proper funding, or in its protests of Republican members of Congress who supported rolling back the Affordable Care Act. But now Mr. King and Housing Works find themselves in an unusual position: Over 100 employees walked off the job on Tuesday to protest the organization’s resistance to their bid to form a union. The workers say that Housing Works’s stance demonstrates the organization’s embrace of corporate values, and is a betrayal of its core identity. “Any organization that calls itself a social justice organization that champions itself as a vanguard of progressive ideals, they should be supporting and allowing workers to assert their rights through a union,” said Elena Rodriguez, a lawyer at Housing Works who has aided the unionization efforts. “I don’t think the two are at odds.” The walkout comes nearly a year after workers began organizing with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in an effort to get Housing Works to address a number of grievances — such as heavy caseloads, high insurance premiums and restrictions on paid time off — that they say have eroded the workplace culture and made it difficult to serve their clients. Workers said they had hoped that Housing Works, which has hosted public events featuring labor leaders and demonstrated alongside unions, would be more supportive of their efforts. Instead, they say Housing Works has employed hardball tactics that corporations often use in resisting unionization. For instance, it has hired a lawyer who specializes in union avoidance and has refused to hand over a list of employee contact information. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said a major sticking point in the talks with Housing Works was the nonprofit’s refusal to sign an agreement that would bar it from interfering in union organizing. “Even large, for-profit entities that do not consider themselves progressive in any way agree to neutrality,” he said. Mr. Appelbaum said that his union had repeatedly tried to negotiate the terms of the agreement, but that Mr. King had not been receptive. The union also plans to file unfair labor practice charges against Housing Works, claiming it has intimidated workers before the walkout. Mr. King says the agency has an open-door policy that gives workers access to management and encourages lower-level workers to share ideas and grievances. He said that Housing Works was not opposed in principle to signing a neutrality agreement, but that he believed that certain provisions in the agreement were biased in favor of the union. “It’s not for me to say that these employees should recognize this union as their bargaining entity,” he said. “The union needs to do its job and sell itself to our employees.” Founded in 1990 at the height of the AIDS pandemic by Mr. King and other leaders from the AIDS activist group Act Up, Housing Works set out to combat the virus by providing housing to homeless and low-income New Yorkers living with H.I.V. Although it started as a small charity with only six employees, Housing Works has morphed into one of the largest comprehensive service providers in the nation for people with H.I.V., employing nearly 800 workers. This year, it merged with Bailey House, another service provider in New York. The organization funds its programs and advocacy work through grants and donations, as well as a sprawling retail operation that includes 13 thrift stores and one bookstore. Mr. King acknowledges that the organization is changing, but denies that its leadership is anti-union. He says Housing Works has maintained the spirit of community through policies that encourage workers to share their ideas and concerns. Not all of his employees agree. Ms. Rodriguez, the staff lawyer, said that landing a job there was a dream come true. But soon after she started, Ms. Rodriguez said, she noticed things that she believed contradicted the organization’s progressive values. The tipping point for Ms. Rodriguez came about a year ago, after a colleague who was fired had to pack up her things in front of everyone in the office before being escorted from the building. “It was really, really hard for us to believe that Housing Works would treat someone who was part of our staff and part of our family in such a heartless and sort of corporate way,” she said. Brian Grady, a housing coordinator, said that as a gay man, he was first attracted to Housing Works because of the legacy it earned during the AIDS pandemic. Although he enjoyed his work, Mr. Grady said the workload had begun to wear him down. For months, he was the only housing coordinator for a program with nearly 3,000 clients. “It’s difficult work,” he said. “We work with people who are going through some of the worst times in their lives and are going through a lot of really unstable situations. As workers we take a lot of that home, especially when we’re hearing these stories day after day with limited resources to help.” Part of the problem is high turnover. Workers said that the demanding nature of their jobs meant that people were frequently coming and going. According to Housing Works’s 2019-20 strategic objective plan, its annual turnover rate is about 30 percent. Ms. Rodriguez said the organization’s high turnover rate hurt Housing Works’s clients. She spoke about one client who was evicted and had to enter the shelter system because Housing Works could not find her a new home in time. “Over the course of more than a year, I saw her shuffled to three new case managers,” Ms. Rodriguez said, adding, “I can’t help but think back to that client and wonder what we could have done better to assist her.” Mr. King said that he sympathized with workers’ concerns, but that he doubted a union would be able to solve all of their issues. “Housing Works already pays much higher than the average salary for community-based organizations in New York City and we already have much lower caseloads,” he said. “So the likelihood that it’s going to dramatically change, that is just not real in a Medicaid-funded program.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
